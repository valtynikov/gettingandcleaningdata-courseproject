# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set][1] was used as the data source for this assignment. The data can be downloaded from <https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip>.

The R code in the [run_analysis.R][2] script was used to generate the final data set for the project. Some of the R code depends on the functionality provided by the [plyr][3] package.

The [CodeBook.md][4] file provides some additional information about the transformations performed to clean and analyze the data.
